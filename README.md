## Settings

| Setting                    | Required | Default                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

A full list of supported settings and capabilities is available by running: `target-snowflake --about`

### Initializing a Snowflake Account

This target has an interactive feature that will help you get a Snowflake account initialized with everything needed to get started loading data.

- User
- Role
- Warehouse
- Database
- Proper grants

The CLI will ask you to provide information about the new user/role/etc. you want to create but it will also need SYSADMIN credentials to execute the queries.
You should prepare the following inputs:

- Account
- User that has SYSADMIN and SECURITYADMIN access. These comes default with the user that created the Snowflake account.
- The password for your SYSADMIN user.

Run the following command to get started with the interactive CLI.
Note - the CLI will print the SQL queries it is planning to run and confirm with you before it makes any changes.

```bash
poetry run target-snowflake --initialize

# Alternatively using Meltano CLI
meltano invoke target-snowflake --initialize
```

The CLI also has a "dry run" mode that will print the queries without executing them.

Check out the demo of this [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/9vEFxw-0nxI).

### Configure using environment variables

This Singer target will automatically import any environment variables within the working directory's
`.env` if the `--config=ENV` is provided, such that config values will be considered if a matching
environment variable is set either in the terminal context or in the `.env` file.

## Usage

You can easily run `target-snowflake` by itself or in a pipeline using [Meltano](https://meltano.com/).

### Executing the Target Directly

```bash
target-snowflake --version
target-snowflake --help
# Test using the "Carbon Intensity" sample:
tap-carbon-intensity | target-snowflake --config /path/to/target-snowflake-config.json
```

## Developer Resources

### Initialize your Development Environment

```bash
pipx install poetry
poetry install
```

### Create and Run Tests

Create tests within the `target_snowflake/tests` subfolder and
  then run:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

You can also test the `target-snowflake` CLI interface directly using `poetry run`:

```bash
poetry run target-snowflake --help
```

### Testing with [Meltano](https://meltano.com/)

_**Note:** This target will work in any Singer environment and does not require Meltano.
Examples here are for convenience and to streamline end-to-end orchestration scenarios._

Your project comes with a custom `meltano.yml` project file already created.

Next, install Meltano (if you haven't already) and any needed plugins:

```bash
# Install meltano
pipx install meltano
# Initialize meltano within this directory
cd target-snowflake
meltano install
```

Now you can test and orchestrate using Meltano:

```bash
# Test invocation:
meltano invoke target-snowflake --version
# OR run a test `elt` pipeline with the Carbon Intensity sample tap:
meltano run tap-carbon-intensity target-snowflake
```

develop your own Singer taps and targets.
